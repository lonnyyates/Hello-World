# Hello-World
Intalling Server/PHP/Database with MediaWiki and various extensions. May try to create my own.
Hey all, I started my career in computers in 1995 when I decided to get an associates degree in computer science. 
I played tech support "expert" for Packard Bell/NEC/Zenith, then tech support for Ameritech, then I went out on my own contracting with Compumaster as a Trainer. That was the best job ever. Traveling all around the country teaching "Troubleshooting, Upgraging, and Repairing PC's" The problem is that I stayed mostly in the hardware side of the house neglecting programming. I was taught 9 different languages, but they are not used much at all today so I have to learn everything anew. I'm pretty good with programming spreadsheets, and a database now and then, but I would consider myself a beginner with everyone here. So if you see me doing stupid stuff, please give me a swift kick in the rear.
